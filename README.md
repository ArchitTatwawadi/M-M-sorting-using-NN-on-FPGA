# M-M-sorting-using-NN-on-FPGA
This project deals with implementation of trained NN on FPGA development board to sort different colored M&amp;M's.
The data for M&M's was collected using a script running on raspberry pi board. Once the data was collected, it was trained on a Neural Network model using Keras Library and trained weights were saved. These weights were then deployed on an Xilinx FPGA board.
